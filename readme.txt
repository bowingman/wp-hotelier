== Description ==

= Features =

Easy WP Hotelier is a complete booking system for WordPress. Some of the features are:

* Three different booking modes: instant booking, manual booking (requires admin approval) and booking disabled.
* Accept payments: require a deposit at the time of booking or charge the entire stay.
* Advanced room settings: manage rooms, beds, and prices.
* Seasonal prices: increase reservations by offering discounts on off-seasons.
* Mark a room non cancellable and non refundable.
* List your rooms by using shortcodes.
* Email notifications.

= How it works? =

Easy WP Hotelier allows you to create two types of rooms: standard or with rates. A room with rates (variable room) lets you define variations of a room where each variation may have a different price, required deposit or conditions.

A room represents a type of room or accommodation available at your hotel. For example, if your hotel offers three "double rooms" with the same price, amenities, etc., just create only one room and set the stock quantity to 3.

Reservations are created when a guest completes the booking process or when the Administrator (or the Hotel Manager) adds a reservation manually. When a guest makes a reservation, the availability (stock) of the room is reduced automatically.

Three different pricing options are supported out of the box: global price, different price for each day of the week and seasonal prices. And a convenient booking calendar for hotel administrators it’s included in the core.
